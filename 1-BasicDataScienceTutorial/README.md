# DataScienceTutorial
This repo contains informational codes and notes related to data science, which have been created on Jupyter-Notebook. The actual owner of the codes is DATAI Team and I just reorganized the structure of the document and add some additive code samples and notes to make it more understandable also translated it to Turkish. Hope you enjoy it and find it useful.
